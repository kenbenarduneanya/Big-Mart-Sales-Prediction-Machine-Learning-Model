# BIG MART SALES PREDICTION MACHINE LEARNING MODEL

## Supermarket Sales Prediction Model

Welcome to the Supermarket Sales Prediction Model! ðŸ›’ðŸ”®

## Overview

This repository contains a machine learning model designed to predict sales for outlets in a supermarket. Whether you're a data wizard or a curious... This README will guide you through the magic behind our predictions.

## Motivation

Sales prediction is crucial for optimizing inventory, staffing, and overall business strategy. By forecasting sales accurately, we empower supermarket managers to make informed decisions and keep their shelves stocked with just the right amount of magic.

## Getting Started

1. **Installation**:

2. **Dependencies**:
   - Our potion recipe requires Python 3.7+ and the following magical ingredients:
     ```
     pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
     ```

3. **Usage**:
   - Brew the model by running:
     ```
     python predict_sales.py
     ```

## Methodology

1. **Data**:
   - Dataset contains historical sales data, outlet information, and other important features.
   - Cleanse the data, handle missing values, and transform it into a format our model can understand.

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   -  Create new features like day of the week, seasonality, and moon phase.
   - Extract magical insights from existing features (e.g., outlet type, location).

3. **Model Selection**:
   - We've chosen the powerful Random Forest spellbook for its ability to handle non-linear relationships and feature importance.

4. **Training and Validation**:
   - Split the data into training and validation sets.
   - Train the model on the training set and evaluate its performance using validation metrics.

5. **Results**:
   - Our model predicts sales with High accuracy.
